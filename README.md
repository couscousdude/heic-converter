# heic-converter
A small NodeJS CLI utility that mass converts HEIC files to PNG format.

## How to run
Download the repo as a folder and `cd` into it.

Run `node main.js`.

You will be prompted to give a path for the files to be converted, and the destination path. 

!IMPORTANT: The destination path will be completely wiped before the program runs, so be careful! Make sure to make a new folder for the files.

After inputting the parameters, the program will begin working.
